# schema:sdLicense

This extension allows the `schema:sdLicense` to be applied on all `schema:Thing` instances.

In schema.org, the license application was so far limited to `schema:CreativeWork`, which is not sufficient for applying licenses to an entire knowledge graph. Therefore we extended the domain of `schema:sdLicense` to `schema:Thing`.
