# odta:PointOfInterest

The new odta:PointOfInterst class is a sub-class of schema:Place and was added as an extension because practitioners frequently requested it. The concept of a point of interest is commonly used in real life.

In schema.org it was not sufficiently covered by schema:CivicStructure or schema:TouristAttraction and schema:Place was too generic. We will add use cases soon.
